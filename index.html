				The day I lost my very first tooth,<br />
				Was halfway through grade four,<br />
				I’d run my tongue along the gap,<br />
				Where my tooth had been before,<br />
				I remember I went home crying,<br />
				And showed it to my mum,<br />
				She told me that a brand new tooth,<br />
				Would grow up in my gum,<br />
				In a while the gap would stop feeling strange,<br />
				I wouldn’t notice the tooth was gone,<br />
				The only reason I missed it now,<br />
				Was because it was there for so long,<br />
				Then slowly but surely over the weeks,<br />
				In the gap a new tooth grew,<br />
				And now it makes me wonder,<br />
				If people are like teeth too.
